# Team YAN: Deep Learning CS 6953 / ECE 7123 2025 Spring

This is the project respository for team YAN - Nidhi, Athul, Yumiko

## Install Libraries
Install the libraries with the specific version mentioned in requirements.txt

## Training.
We had trained the models in the HPC burst node for efficient compute (4 GPUs and 12 cores).

## Final Model:
The final model is at `notebooks/LORA_for_news_classification.ipynb`

results folder contains the `inference_output.csv` which are the inferences made by the model on unlabelled data (`test_unlabelled.pkl`)
